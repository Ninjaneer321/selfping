# selfping
HTTP ping to your site. Measure network quaility between your site and customers when customers can not run ping.

Default target URL is this script url (window.location.href), but you can change it in code to something different.
It will work for same site only (because of CORS restrictions).

In the end - it will show basic summary.

Install - just put [selfping.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaroslaff/selfping/master/selfping.html) somewhere on your site.
